<p>Choquet-Bruhat is known for her applications of PDE theory and differential geometry to mathematical physics and is responsible for much of the modern mathematical formulation of general relativity, with a unique simultaneous grasp of both the mathematics and the physics of the theory. Although she is a mathematician, Choquet-Bruhat emphasises that she has never lost sight of the fact that general relativity is a physical theory and takes an interest in observations and new experimental data, especially if it is relevant to GR<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>. She was the first woman to be elected as a full member of the French Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>I will not recapitulate all the details of GR here, as this is really a book about mathematics, but essentially at the heart of it you have a set of PDEs called the Einstein equations, which tell you that the presence of matter causes the curvature of spacetime (roughly speaking).</p>

<p>where <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> is the Einstein tensor for the curvature and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T"> is the energy-momentum tensor which describes classical flow and density of energy and momentum. Einstein was originally unsure of how he was going to deal with the geometric problem of curvature of spacetime manifolds, but realised by asking around that the basic mathematical theory of curvature of manifolds of arbitrary dimension had already been laid down many years before by Riemann. General relativity explains several effects which cannot be explained by Newtonian mechanics, and can also be applied to cosmology. There are many books and review articles which outline relativistic cosmology in more detail<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A famous correction from general relativity is to the precession of the perihelion of Mercury. The observed rate of precession of Mercury’s perihelion disagrees with Newtonian mechanics, even after all other factors have been accounted for (the perihelion of an orbit of a body being the point where it comes closest to the Sun). Most of the observed secular precession of the perihelion of Mercury can be explained via precession of the equinoxes and perturbations of the orbit by other planets, but after these effects are dealt with, there is still an observed precession of approximately 43 arcseconds per century. If one takes the Kepler problem for a bound orbit perturbed by a central force and includes a perturbation Hamiltonian due to the Schwarzchild solution for weak gravitational fields, one obtains a value for the average rate of precession which is 42.98 arcseconds per century. Observation currently tells us that the precession due to relativistic effects is 43.1 <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmp"> 0.5 arcseconds per century, an insignificant deviation from theory<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>.</p>
<p>To illustrate this visually, one can use any piece of computer algebra software to numerically solve an ODE for the orbit</p>

<p>(In classical mechanics, it can be shown that adding a potential which is proportional to <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%2Fr%5E%7B2%7D"> corresponds to an elliptical orbit in a rotating coordinate system). When we create the plot for the orbit after several revolutions, we see that there is a shift in the perihelion which was not present in the Newtonian case.</p>

<p>One can then find the angular positions of the consecutive perihelia by taking the minimum distance of the orbit from the origin for every revolution (ie. wherever <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5Cleft%28%20%5Cphi%20%5Cright%29"> is a minimum).</p>
<p>This is all well and good and there is no doubting the physical success of the theory, but one must still answer a number of mathematical questions and problems regarding the Einstein equations, a project which Choquet-Bruhat began to contribute to under the supervision of Einstein. For example, it is not immediately obvious that the Einstein equations are mathematically well posed as set of differential equations. A PDE problem is said to be well posed if there exists a unique solution which depends continuously on the initial data which you feed in. If you recall our earlier discussion of the Cauchy problem, this problem is not well posed for elliptic PDEs and solutions of the problem must be analytic. If the equations are hyperbolic, the problem is well posed for analytic and also for smooth functions. For linear second-order systems on a Lorentzian manifold <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%28%20N%5E%7Bn%20%2B%201%7D%2Cg%20%5Cright%29"> which read as</p>

<p>the Cauchy problem with intitial data on a spacelike hypersurface of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N%5E%7Bn%20%2B%201%7D"> is globally well posed, if you assume the right function spaces and the right assumptions on the Cauchy data. The solution to the system is smooth if <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%28%20N%5E%7Bn%20%2B%201%7D%2Cg%20%5Cright%29"> and the Cauchy data are smooth. In particular, the solution at a point only depends on the values for the initial data in the past of this point, as we would expect from the physical assumption of relativistic causality<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>. To see that a solution is global simply means that it exists on all of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7Bn%20%2B%201%7D">, although it might still grow. The Einstein equations for a vacuum form a quasi-linear, second-order system of PDEs for the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%28n%20%2B%201%29%28n%20%2B%202%29%2F2"> coefficients of the metric: the PDEs have both hyperbolic and elliptic character (not easy to deal with). As the system is geometric with an obvious geometric interpretation, the equations are invariant under diffeomorphisms of the manifold in question and the isometries of the metric.</p>
<p>As a consequence of diffeomorphism invariance, one can use the contracted Bianchi identities to reduce the number of independent equations. In the classical case where the dimension of the Lorentzian manifold is 4, one can use the Bianchi identities to reduce the number of equations for the metric coefficients from 10 to 6, implying 4 ‘loose’ degrees of freedom, which have to be fixed by the user by choosing a 4-dimensional local coordinate system. The choice of local coordinates is called ‘choosing the gauge’ in theoretical physics lingo. A natural choice for many years was to make the requirement that the functions which define the local coordinates satisfy a system of wave equations:</p>

<p>are known as the harmonically reduced Einstein equations. The Cauchy problem becomes the problem of constructing a solution along with its first derivatives given initial values on a spacelike submanifold of the Lorentzian manifold. This leads to a theorem that this Cauchy problem (the Cauchy problem for the vacuum Einstein equations in wave gauge) is well posed and has a unique local solution which depends continuously on the initial data (modulo all the relevant theory where we take the functions to be living in the right Sobolev space with the right number of derivatives). Again, causality is implied, since the value at a point only depends on the initial in the past of that point<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A further result states that the Cauchy problem for the vacuum Einstein equations with initial data <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g_%7B%5Ctext%7B%CE%B1%CE%B2%7D%7D"> on a spacelike hypersurface and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpartial_%7Bt%7Dg_%7B%5Ctext%7B%CE%B1%CE%B2%7D%7D"> satisfying the wave gauge constraints has a time-local solution which is a Lorentzian metric depending on the initial data in a continuous manner. This solution exists and is locally unique<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>. This is for an Einstein spacetime which is constructed in local coordinates in a neighbourhood of a hypersurface from initial data <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g_%7B%5Ctext%7B%CE%B1%CE%B2%7D%7D"> and a Lorentzian metric for which the hypersurface is spacelike. The wave gauge constraints are the following constraints on the initial data when restricted to the hypersurface:</p>
<center><p><br><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G%5E%7B%5Calpha%200%7D%20-%20T%5E%7B%5Calpha%200%7D%20%3D%200."><br></p></center>
<p>These constraints must hold for a solution of the harmonically reduced Einstein equations to also be a solution to the original Einstein equations: these are called the wave gauge constraints since they fix the metric in wave gauge.</p>
<p>In order to obtain results on global uniqueness, we must give a geometric formulation of the Cauchy problem which we mentioned earlier, where an initial data set is a triple <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%28%20M%2Cg%2Ck%20%5Cright%29"> with <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%28%20M%2Cg%20%5Cright%29"> a Riemannian <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-manifold equipped with a metric and a symmetric 2-tensor.

Results about hyperbolic PDEs then tell us that an initial data set for the Einstein vacuum equations satisfying a pair of geometric constraints admits a vaccum development which is locally unique modulo isometries. The constraints are:</p>

A fairly recent conjecture (known as the bounded <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E%7B2%7D"> curvature conjecture) is that sufficient conditions for the existence of a Lorentzian metric solution of the vacuum Einstein equations in a neighbourhood of a Riemannian 3-manifold <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> equipped with a metric <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coverline%7Bg%7D"> and a 2-tensor <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> are that</p>

<p>(ie. that the Ricci tensor as a function which picks up the metric and evaluates it lives in the space <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E%7B2%7D">), that <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coverline%7B%5Cnabla%7Dk"> lives in <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E%7B2%7D"> locally on the 3-manifold and that the volume radius for the manifold equipped with that metric has to be strictly positive. The conjecture was recently proved by its originators<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>.</p>
<p>From here, one would like to obtain information about global properties of solutions. An important definition is that of global hyperbolicity for general hyperbolic PDEs. This is interpreted as meaning that a path in the relevant function space between two points whose tangent lives in the cone which determines the domain of dependence of solutions is compact. We earlier defined a Cauchy surface, and it can be proved that the existence of a Cauchy surface implies global hyperbolicity. These definitions can be used to obtain the result that a vacuum Einstein development of an initial data triple satisfies the vacuum Einstein constraints always exists and that it is unique in the space of globally hyperbolic spacetime. The manifold in the initial data is a Cauchy hypersurface. A solution is global if it is a complete Lorentzian manifold. A discussion of the problem of global existence for solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations would require more advanced mathematics which is well beyond the scope of this small book<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>.</p>
<p>One of the most important problems in general relativity is that of the positive mass theorem (also known as the positive energy theorem). This problem has a long and interesting history which is in a sense unfinished, since it leads to the general Penrose conjecture. Essentially speaking, there is no well-defined way of talking about the energy density of a gravitational field. The only satisfactory picture of the total energy density field is an asymptotic one, where the density is defined in terms of the behaviour of the field as one goes away from the spacetime out towards spatial infinity. It is not clear that this definition for the total gravitational energy has to be zero or positive. The positive energy theorem makes the claim that a gravitational system with non-negative local matter density has to have non-negative total energy, when that energy is measured asymptotically as one goes to infinity.</p>
<p>The theorem can also be stated in an equivalent way which is known as the positive mass theorem (note that physicists seem to prefer calling it the positive energy theorem, whereas mathematicians tend to call it positive mass). Most importantly, the theorem can be formulated in geometric terms, which is more satisfactory given that general relativity is written in the language of differential geometry. One starts with a three dimensional Riemannian manifold equipped with a metric <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%28%20N%2Cg%20%5Cright%29">. We then take an initial data set consisting of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> and a symmetric 2-tensor <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h"> (the extrinsic curvature) which satisfy equations of constraint for the local matter and momentum densities:</p>

<p>where <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R"> is the scalar curvature.

<p>The quantity <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M_%7Bi%7D"> is the ADM mass of the end <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N_%7Bi%7D">. The theorem then says that for an asymptotically flat initial data set, each end has non-negative total mass and if only one of the ends has zero mass, then the initial data set vanishes and the Riemann tensor is zero<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>. This is like saying that an isolated gravitating system with non-negative local mass density has non-negative total mass, when the mass is measured asymptotically at infinity.</p>
<p>The overall strategy from the geometric point of view is to first prove what one might call the ‘Riemannian’ positive mass theorem, where the second fundamental form of the spacelike hypersurface in the spacetime vanishes to zero. This is equivalent to the hypersurface being ‘time-symmetric’ or totally geodesic, where a totally geodesic Riemannian submanifold is one such that for every <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V"> in the tangent bundle, the geodesic <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cgamma_%7BV%7D"> lies entirely in the larger manifold <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> when viewed in terms of the induced metric associated with the submanifold. In reality, it is only quite special hypersurfaces which have a vanishing second fundamental form even from the mathematical point of view, and one would not expect a ‘real’ hypersurface embedded in a spacetime to have zero second fundamental form, so it is certainly not sufficient to prove the special case from a physical point of view. However, one can then employ a quasilinear elliptic PDE called the Jang equation to reduce the theorem for general Cauchy data back to the time-symmetric case, which then proves the theorem in general<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Although other mathematicians and physicists made progress on proving particular cases of the theorem (Choquet-Bruhat and Marsden showed that it was true if the data are close enough to flat data in a particular smooth norm, for example), it was actually two differential geometers Schoen and Yau who gave the first proof, using the arguments sketched above<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>. Another proof by Witten followed quite soon: this proof was completely different and used identities for Dirac spinors<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>. The idea is to take a Lorentzian 4-manifold (spacetimes in general relativity are always modelled by this type of manifold) which contains an embedded space-like hypersurface. We assume that the manifold satisfies the Einstein equations and that the manifold of the spacelike hypersurface is asymptotic to Euclidean 3-space as one goes to infinity in the 4-manifold. We then take the spinor bundle <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> of the 4-manifold with its canonical connection and restrict the bundle equipped with this connection to the spacelike hypersurface. If we take a local orthonormal frame field in the usual way, we have a Dirac operator on the restriction of the spinor bundle:</p>

<p>One then writes the square of the Dirac operator</p>
<center><p><br><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D%5E%7B2%7D%20%3D%20%5Cnabla%5E%7B%2A%7D%5Cnabla%5Cmathfrak%7B%2B%20I%7D%2C"><br></p></center>
<p>where the second term only involves the second fundamental form of the spacelike hypersurface.</p>
<p>One can then demonstrate the positivity of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathfrak%7BI%7D">, which shows that the Dirac operator can be inverted on the right subspaces of the space of sections of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S">. As the hypersurface is asymptotically flat, we just have to take solutions of the equation</p>
<center><p><br><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D%5Csigma%20%3D%200"><br></p></center>
<p>and show that there exist unique solutions for every asymptotically constant value. Once we have such a solution <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">, we take a region of the hypersurface and use our identity for the square of the Dirac operator to get</p>

The fact that this integral is strictly positive allows us to show that the total energy is also strictly positive<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>. Witten’s proof is appealing, since the mass appears as an integral of a positive quantity over the manifold. It is worth mentioning, however, that although Witten’s proof appears simpler than the proof of Schoen and Yau, some work still needs to be done to establish the existence of a Green’s function for the Dirac operator on a hypersurface. This is essential, since Witten assumes that it makes mathematical sense to work with a Dirac operator on a spacelike hypersurface<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>. There are now a variety of proofs up to arbitrary dimension and without the assumption of spin manifolds, including a proof of the three-dimensional case with Ricci flow<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a>. Choquet-Bruhat herself uploaded a slicker, cleaner spinor proof which is valid for spin manifolds of any dimension and which does not require spacetime spinors<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The story does not end here, however, as one still needs to put black holes into the picture (probably the most famous object associated with general relativity). Although the derivation is obviously not this simple, one could intuitively think of this an extension of the positive mass theorem, but now instead of saying the mass is zero or more than zero, we are saying that the mass of the manifold is equal either to the mass of the black holes which it contains, or that it exceeds the mass of those black holes. Also, instead of retreating back to Minkowski spacetime as the flat space, we now go back to the Schwarzchild spacetime for a non-rotating spherically symmetric black hole. Using a physical argument based on various theorems from general relativity and the cosmic censorship hypothesis (which proposes that a naked singularity can never be observed in the Universe outside of a black hole), Penrose conjectured that the following inequality always holds:</p>
<center><p><br><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20%5Cleq%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7BA%7D%7B16%5Cpi%7D%7D%2C"><br></p></center>
<p>where <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> is the ADM mass of an asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface in a spacetime and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> is the area of the event horizons of all the black holes in the spacetime.</p>
<p>If we assume that the second fundamental form vanishes, then the problem can be formulated so that we only need to prove what is known as the Riemannian Penrose inequality. This states that</p>
<center><p><br><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20%5Cleq%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7BA_%7B0%7D%7D%7B16%5Cpi%7D%7D%2C"><br></p></center>
<p>where the hypersurface has non-negative scalar curvature and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_%7B0%7D"> is the area of the outermost minimal surface <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CSigma_%7B0%7D"> of the submanifold <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%28%20M%5E%7B3%7D%2Cg%20%5Cright%29">. Interestingly, the two proofs of the Riemannian Penrose inequality so far rely on geometric flows. A geometric flow is a gradient flow on a manifold with a simple geometric interpretation (a PDE with specific geometric meaning, if you like). This is different from the notion of a global flow which you may have encountered on other manifolds courses, which is a family of diffeomorphisms of a manifold determined by the collection of all the integral curves of some chosen vector field on the manifold. As an example, the coordinate vector field <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V%20%3D%20%5Cpartial%2F%5Cpartial%20x"> on <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B2%7D"> generates a flow which shifts the plane to the right or the left (depending on whether <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> is positive or negative). This flow is determined by the integral curves, which are straight lines parallel to the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x">-axis<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The two most famous examples of geometric flows are probably Ricci flow and mean curvature flow (curve-shortening flow is just mean curvature flow in one dimension). A map <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F"> from a family of hypersurfaces <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M%5E%7Bn%7D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cleft%5Clbrack%200%2CT%20%5Cright%29"> to <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%28%20N%5E%7Bn%20%2B%201%7D%2C%5Coverline%7Bg%7D%20%5Cright%29"> solves mean curvature flow if</p>

<p>where <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coverrightarrow%7BH%7D"> is the mean curvature vector. This is a quasi-linear, second-order system of parabolic PDEs. The equation is not strictly parabolic, as it is invariant under tangential diffeomorphisms (diffeomorphisms which arbitrarily slide the manifold around, in some sense), meaning that the principal symbol has some zero directions. However, a PDE can only be strictly parabolic if the associated principal symbol is always positive when evaluated for any pair <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%28%20x%2C%5Cxi%20%5Cright%29"> in <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T%5E%7B%2A%7DM">. In geometric terms, the flow evolves a family of surfaces in a Riemannian manifold by evolving the normal components of vectors at points on the surface by a speed which is equal to the mean curvature at that point. It is also possible to define a flow called inverse mean curvature flow, where the same is done, but now for the inverse of the mean curvature. This would seem like a difficult flow to use in applications, since it can develop singularities easily and looks to be undefined if the mean curvature at a point is zero.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to use a level sets approach for the Penrose conjecture to show that the surface <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CSigma%5Cleft%28%20t%20%5Cright%29"> which results from inverse mean curvature flow of a minimal surface after time <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> can be defined as the level set of a function <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> on <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%28%20M%5E%7B3%7D%2Cg%20%5Cright%29"> such that</p>

<p>One can define a suitable weak existence theory for this degenerate elliptic PDE and prove existence of solutions. Since the Hawking mass is monotone on the level sets of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> and is eventually bounded by the ADM mass as the surfaces evolve, this proves the Riemannian Penrose inequality and provides yet another independent proof of the positive mass theorem<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a>. The Huisken-Ilmanen proof actually establishes a slightly weaker result: the Riemannian Penrose inequality for the <em>largest</em> black hole in the manifold. One could imagine more than one black hole in a spacetime and, indeed, multiple black holes have been observed in Nature in the form of black hole mergers. A different flow (conformal flow of metrics) was used by Bray to prove the inequality for any number of black holes. Essentially, one takes a flow of metrics which meets a certain number of criteria and which converges back to the Schwarzchild metric, although there are many other technical details and lemmas to deal with. Whereas Huisken and Ilmanen give a new proof of the positive mass theorem, Bray assumes it and applies it at several key points of his argument<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>. It is not entirely clear what, if any, is the physical interpretation of Bray’s proof, although such an interpretation has been suggested in the physics literature<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The general case where the hypersurface in the spacetime is not totally geodesic is still an open question. One might hope that we could follow the example of Schoen and Yau and use something like the Jang equation to reduce the general case back to the Riemannian Penrose inequality, but there are technical reasons why this is difficult or impossible. The PDE approach to proving the conjecture where one tries to find existence theory for a set of PDEs which imply the Riemannian inequality is perhaps an intractable problem, since one must somehow establish an existence theorem with the correct boundary conditions compatible with the type of horizon being considered (whatever those conditions might be). A counterexample was found to a stronger version of the Penrose conjecture for objects called generalized apparent horizons: if an explicit counterexample can be found for a strong version, this suggests that it might be almost impossible to establish the necessary existence theory for the normal weaker version of the conjecture<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a>.</p>
