<p>Viazovska is well known for work on sphere packing and combinatorial design theory. She spectacularly solved the sphere-packing problem in dimensions <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?8"> and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?24">. This was something of a surprise, as the solution of the problem for dimension less than or equal to <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3"> involved a computer-assisted proof and many arduous computer calculations, whereas Viazovska used the kinds of more traditional arguments which one would associate with a proof. There is still some debate about the necessity of computer-verified proofs and the future role that computers and machine learning will play in the business of formal proof theory. Certainly, it is possible that computers will be used routinely in the future to prove lemmas which would otherwise be very tedious to prove: this type of lemma is common in commutative algebra, for example. Computer scientists have been using formal proof verification tools for decades, but in general, the mathematical community has not paid much attention. The fact that Viazovska used arguments with modular forms to solve cases of a problem which had previously only been thought amenable to computer-assisted proof suggests that there might not necessarily be an <em>essential</em> place for this type of proof in the future of mathematics, and that adaptation of these methods might depend on whether mathematicians wish to use them or find them helpful, rather than on any actual necessity.</p>
<p>Maybe the most famous of the computer-assisted proofs are the proofs of the four-colour theorem and the Kepler conjecture. There are many expositions of both these results and the proofs in the popular mathematics literature, but we will go through them anyway<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257" role="doc-noteref"><sup>257</sup></a>. The theorem originates in cartography. Perhaps you yourself have printed off a white copy of a map of some country divided up into states or counties and then seen how few colours you need to colour the whole thing in, assuming that states which are next to each other or have a common border are different colours. Experiment would seem to suggest that the minimum number of colours needed to do this is <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4">, but how would one go about proving this? As always, we might begin by formulating the problem in mathematical language. Start with a map <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D"> and call <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D_%7B%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%7D"> the set of all the states of the map. One has <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> colours with which to fill in these states. An <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-colouring of the map is a mapping <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarphi%3A%5C%20%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D_%7B%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%7D%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%201%2C%5C%20%5Cldots%2C%5C%20n%20%5Cright%5C%7D">. An <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-colouring is said to be admissible if neighbouring countries which share a common border always have distinct function values (these function values corresponding to colours).</p>
<p>We might also want to consider permutations of the colours. Let <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarphi%3A%5C%20%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D_%7B%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%7D%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%201%2C%5C%20%5Cldots%2C%5C%20n%20%5Cright%5C%7D"> be an admissible <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-colouring of a map and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpi%3A%5C%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%201%2C%5C%20%5Cldots%2C%5C%20n%20%5Cright%5C%7D%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%201%2C%5C%20%5Cldots%2C%5C%20n%20%5Cright%5C%7D"> be a permutation, then it can be shown that the composition <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpi%20%5Ccirc%20%5Cvarphi"> is also an admissible <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-colouring. Two colourings of a map are considered to be equivalent if they only differ by a permutation of colours. We can now state the four-colour theorem as follows: every map has an admissible <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4">-colouring. Without going into the details, the basic approach to proving this theorem is investigate a kind of counterexample which is often referred to as a ‘minimal criminal’. The idea of the counterexample is that if there does exist a map which cannot be coloured with four colours, then there has to be a map of this kind containing the fewest number <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> of countries. A map with four countries can trivially be coloured in with four colours (or assigned numbers from a set of four numbers, if you prefer), so the fewest number of countries has to be bigger than four. A map which has fewer than <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> countries admits a <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4">-colouring. A map with <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> countries that does not admit a <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4">-colouring is called a minimal criminal in the literature. The aim is to show that such a minimal criminal cannot exist. The problem can also be formulated as a combinatorial problem with no reference to geometry<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258" role="doc-noteref"><sup>258</sup></a>. A similar problem in combinatorics known as the Hadwiger-Nelson problem asks for the minimum number of colours which are need to colour the plane such that no two points at unit distance from each other have the same colour. Recent progress on this issue was made by de Grey, who showed that the minimum number is at least <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?5"> by presenting a number of finite unit-distance graphs in the plane which are not <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4">-colourable. The smallest of these has <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1581"> vertices. This proof was also computer-assisted<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259" role="doc-noteref"><sup>259</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Kepler conjecture states that the densest possible packing of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B3%7D"> by equal spheres is via what is now called the FCC (face-centred cubic) packing, which fills space with a density of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpi%2F%5Csqrt%7B18%7D%20%5Capprox%2074%5C%25">. The conjecture originally emerged in the applied setting of efficient stacking of cannonballs and it is part of Hilbert’s eighteenth problem. We will not go into the proof here, as it is extremely complicated and would require hundreds of pages even for a sketch. Again, the proof given by Hales and Ferguson is computer-assisted. It was maybe the first proof of its kind at the time and caused a huge amount of controversy and soul-searching about what it really means to say that something has been proved, since the referees of the paper were not able to state certainty about the correctness of the many calculations which had been carried out with a computer<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260" role="doc-noteref"><sup>260</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The FCC lattice is one of several lattice types which are used to describe the crystal structures found in Nature. A crystal is a solid structure in which a group of atoms is arranged in a repeating pattern over a regular three-dimensional grid called a lattice. In fact, Gauss had already proved the Kepler conjecture over a regular lattice prior to the modern proofs. The FCC lattice is a simple cubic lattice, but with an additional lattice point at the centre of every face of every cube. A displacement vector which joins two lattice points is called a lattice vector. If we assume that the structure can be modelled as an infinite crystal, then any displacement by a lattice vector will produce no change in the crystal ie. there is translational symmetry. This implies that the potential energy function for an electron in a crystal obeys a periodicity condition for any lattice vector. This implies Bloch’s theorem: in an infinite crystal structure, the energy eigenfunctions of electrons can be written in the form</p>

<p>The theorem tells us that the energy eigenfunction for an electron in an infinite crystal is the product of the plane wave associated with a free electron multiplied by a periodic function. This explains an old mystery of how it is that electrons appear to move freely through wires even though there must be atoms obstructing them (something which the classical theory cannot explain). In a perfect crystal, the electron eigenfunction extends without stopping as a plane wave (only modulated by the periodic function), so the electron wave is not obstructed by the densely packed atoms around it.</p>
<p>We can apply the Bloch theorem to show trivially that the probability density in a Bloch wave also has the periodicity associated with the lattice. The electron probability density is given by</p>

<p>The result then follows. The values for the wave vector are restricted to a discrete set using appropriate periodic boundary conditions<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261" role="doc-noteref"><sup>261</sup></a>. When considering the unit cell for the FCC lattice, there are eight lattice points on the corners of the cell and a lattice point in the centre of each of the six faces, so the unit cell contains four lattice points. If we fill Euclidean space with FCC unit cells, one sees that the lattice points of an extended FCC lattice are described as points with the usual coordinates where the coordinates are <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D"> for the lattice constant <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a">, or two of the three coordinates are half-odd integers multiplying <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a">, with the remaining coordinate <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D"> as before. The Wigner-Seitz cell for the FCC lattice takes the shape of a rhombic dodecahedron, where every face is the perpendicular bisector between the central point and one of its neighbours. One uses these bisectors to construct the cell, where the Wigner-Seitz cell of a point of a lattice is defined to be the set of all points which are closer to that point than any other lattice point. A simpler lattice is the simple cubic lattice, but most chemical elements cannot form a simple cubic lattice in atomic form, although there is one which does (polonium)<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262" role="doc-noteref"><sup>262</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We have mentioned that the Kepler conjecture was proved with an extremely complicated argument which made liberal use of computer calculations. It was therefore rather unexpected when Viazovska announced short proofs of the corresponding conjecture in dimensions <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?8"> and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?24">. The proof in dimension <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?8"> was done using only modular forms and Fourier analysis and employs an argument which is relatively simple in places, utilizing standard complex analysis and transform theory and quoting results like the Fourier transform of the Gaussian. For <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> an integer, a function is said to be weakly modular of weight <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-%202k%5E%7B%5C%20%7D">if <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> is meromorphic on the half-plane <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BH%7D"> and if it satisfies the following relation:</p>
<center><p><br><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f%5Cleft%28%20z%20%5Cright%29%20%3D%20%5Cleft%28%20cz%20%2B%20d%20%5Cright%29%5E%7B-%202k%7Df%5Cleft%28%20%5Cfrac%7Baz%20%2B%20b%7D%7Bcz%20%2B%20d%7D%20%5Cright%29%2C"><br></p></center>
<p>for all matrices in <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BSL%7D%5Cleft%28%202%2C%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%20%5Cright%29">. You will probably recognise the rational function of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?z"> as a Möbius transformation of the complex plane. Furthermore, if <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> is meromorphic on the half-plane, <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> is a weakly modular function of weight <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2k"> if and only it satisfies two relations:</p>

<p>A weakly modular function is called modular if it is meromorphic at infinity and a modular function which is holomorphic everywhere is called a modular form. If such a function is zero at infinity, the modular form is called a cusp form. From complex analysis, we know that a modular form of weight <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2k"> is given by a series</p>
<center><p><br><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f%5Cleft%28%20z%20%5Cright%29%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bn%20%3D%200%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%7Ba_%7Bn%7Dq%5E%7Bn%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bn%20%3D%200%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7Da_%7Bn%7De%5E%7B2%5Cpi%20inz%7D%2C"><br></p></center>
<p>which has unit radius of convergence. This modular form will be a cusp form if <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_%7B0%7D%20%3D%200">.</p>
<p>If <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f_%7B1%7D"> and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f_%7B2%7D"> are two modular forms with weight <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2k_%7B1%7D"> and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2k_%7B2%7D"> respectively, then the product <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f_%7B1%7Df_%7B2%7D"> is another modular form of weight <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2k_%7B1%7D%20%2B%202k_%7B2%7D">. If we denote by <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> the set of pairs <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%28%20%5Comega_%7B1%7D%2C%5Comega_%7B2%7D%20%5Cright%29"> of elements of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E%7B%2A%7D"> such that <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BIm%7D%5Cleft%28%20%5Comega_%7B1%7D%2F%5Comega_%7B2%7D%20%5Cright%29%20%3E%200">, two elements of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> define the same lattice (not related to the lattices we were talking about before) if and only if they are congruent modulo <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BSL%7D%5Cleft%28%202%2C%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%20%5Cright%29">.

<p>It can be shown that this is an absolutely convergent series of weight <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2k">, known as the Eisenstein series of index <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2k">.

<p>In more formal terms, Viazovska proved that no packing of unit balls in <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B8%7D"> can have a density which is greater than that of the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E_%7B8%7D">-lattice packing. We are interested in a quantity called the sphere packing constant which measures how much of Euclidean <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-space can be covered with unit balls which can touch without overlapping.

If <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is a lattice, then we say that <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D"> is a lattice sphere packing (this is the kind of sphere packing which Gauss studied many years ago). The finite density of a packing <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D"> is defined to be the following ratio of volumes:</p>

<p>The density of the packing is defined to be the limit supremum:</p>

<p>so no prizes for that one. In the Euclidean plane, as you might intuitively expect, the most efficient packing is a hexagonal lattice, where a disc touches six other discs. The density of the hexagonal lattice packing is given by</p>

<p>This is much higher than the corresponding figure which we had for <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B3%7D"> which was proved by Hales and Ferguson:</p>

<p>It is interesting to speculate what this packing constant would be for the case of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B8%7D">. Viasovska proved that it is</p>

<p>Viasovska’s proof that no packing of unit balls in <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B8%7D"> has a density greater than the density of the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E_%7B8%7D">-lattice packing involves the technique of linear programming bounds. This technique enables one to obtain upper bounds in many discrete optimization problems, although these bounds are not always particularly sharp. One might hope that there would be linear programming bounds which could be applied specifically to sphere packings, and that turns out to be the case. Viasovska used these techniques (known as Cohn-Elkies linear programming bounds), including a result which is worth quoting. Take <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f%3A%5C%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7Bd%7D%5Cmathbb%7B%5Crightarrow%20R%7D"> to be some non-zero admissible function.

<p>Viasovska and her colleagues would later return to this question, but now for <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B24%7D">. Based on the proof in eight dimensions, they studied a lattice called the Leech lattice and proved that the Leech lattice achieves the optimal sphere packing density in <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B24%7D">, and that it is the only periodic packing in <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B24%7D"> with that density, modulo scaling and isometries. It follows that the optimal sphere packing density in <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B24%7D"> is equal to that of the Leech lattice.

<p>Linking back to symplectic topology, there is also a symplectic packing problem.

It had already been known since the 1970s that there is a lower bound on this quantity:</p>

<p>A spherical <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-design which attains this lower bound is said to be tight. For a simple example, consider the vertices of a regular <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%28%20t%20%2B%201%20%5Cright%29">-gon: these form a tight spherical <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-design in the circle. Eight tight spherical designs are known to exist for <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20%5Cgeq%202"> and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%20%5Cgeq%204">, but in general, tight spherical designs are rare and it has shown that they only exists for certain values of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> when <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20%5Cgeq%202">.</p>
<p>Viazovska and her colleagues studied the asymptotic bounds on <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N%5Cleft%28%20n%2Ct%20%5Cright%29"> for fixed <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20%5Cgeq%202"> and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> tending to infinity in the limit. They used a theorem related to the Brouwer fixed point theorem familiar from elementary algebraic topology: the theorem says that if <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> is a continuous self-map for Euclidean space and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> an open bounded subset with boundary <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpartial%5COmega"> such that <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0%20%5Cin%20%5COmega">, then if <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft%28%20x%2Cf%5Cleft%28%20x%20%5Cright%29%20%5Cright%29%20%3E%200"> for all <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20%5Cin%20%5Cpartial%5COmega">, then there exists some <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20%5Cin%20%5COmega"> such that <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f%5Cleft%28%20x%20%5Cright%29%20%3D%200">. This theorem is used to prove that for each <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N%20%5Cgeq%20C_%7Bn%7Dt%5E%7Bn%7D">, there exists a spherical <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-design in <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S%5E%7Bn%7D"> consisting of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> points. As well as the previous theorem, the proof also makes use of the concept of an area-regular partition.

<p>In a related paper, Viazovska pushed this approach further by proving that there exist certain configurations in the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-sphere which are spherical <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-designs with a number of points which is asymptotically minimal in the sense which we just described, plus they have the best separation property in asymptotic terms. A sequence of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N">-point configurations <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_%7BN%7D%20%3D%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%20x_%7B1N%7D%2C%5C%20%5Cldots%2C%5C%20x_%7B%5Ctext%7BNN%7D%7D%20%5Cright%5C%7D"> in <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S%5E%7Bn%7D"> is said to be well-separated if</p>

<p>This is a direct generalisation of the previous theorem which we mentioned. (As with the proof of that result, the proof uses degree theory and area-regular partitions)<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269" role="doc-noteref"><sup>269</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Viazovska has also made contributions to pure solid state and semiconductor physics, although this is maybe not too surprising given the connections between packings, lattices and crystal structures which we have touched upon. For example, along with colleagues, she calculated the temperature-dependent London depth in the crystal <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BBa%7D_%7B1%20-%20x%7DK_%7Bx%7D%5Ctext%7BFe%7D_%7B2%7D%5Ctext%7BAs%7D_%7B2%7D"> based on the electronic band structure and momentum-dependent superconducting gap derived from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and muon spin rotation data. The London penetration depth is defined via the following formula:</p>
