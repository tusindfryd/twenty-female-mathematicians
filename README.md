# Twenty Female Mathematicians
## Popularising achievements of women in mathematics
This project is based on a preprint by Hollis Williams. The idea was to make it into an interactive webpage - allowing more people to find it and making it more accessible. Contributions and feedback are welcome! If you have an idea for an improvement or find a bug, please open an issue in <a href="https://github.com/tusindfryd/twenty-female-mathematicians/issues">the issue tracker</a>.

You don't necessarily have to build this site for simple changes, such as CSS or text, but here's how to build it in case you want to:
1. <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/">Install Ruby</a>.
2. <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository">Clone this repo</a>.
3. In your work directory, install the gems with <code>gem install</code>.
4. Run <code>jekyll build</code> and then <code>jekyll serve</code>.
5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:4000.

Happy coding!
